They produce pieces that look great on the surface \u2013 then you dig a little deeper and discover the cavalcade of issues that infest these tumour-adjacent rots like maggots.</p> <p>Stylistic inconsistency. Inaccurate lighting. Faulty anatomy. A piece more concerned with seeming good than being good. I don\u2019t care if you spend weeks perfecting your outputs, because you don\u2019t know what to perfect. Studying anatomy? What a waste of time! They\u2019ll proclaim.

It\u2019s not to do with the quality of the output \u2013 it\u2019s to do with the connotation and meaning of it.</p> <p>Imagine this. You tell some of your acquaintances that your birthday is soon. On the day, your best friend gives you an incredible, artfully crafted gift that they made with their own two hands, tailored to the every atom and texture in your relationship. Your coworker slides along to the party for an hour to drop off a store-bought card and gift, snatching a slice of cake and a party favour and leaving. Which gift do you appreciate more?</p> <p>The genuine one, obviously. And don\u2019t pretend to be some cool edgelord that doesn\u2019t give a shit.</p> <p>This is why handmade art is infinitely better than any imitation a machine cooks up. Real art is made with a story beyond clicking a button. There was effort there, something worth experiencing. Real art comes from a place of passion, not a spiteful urge to highlight your own prowess. Yeah okay, AI allows you to make whatever you want with the press of a button. Whatever you can imagine. With zero effort, so it only works for something that you wouldn\u2019t consider worth spending effort on.

It takes hours and hours to produce something that looks good. Both pieces are incredible. They look amazing and carry the story of effort and process.

We grabbed a mod to make it two-player and did a playthrough.</p> <p>And it was a blast. Beautifully developed story and artwork, with recognizable character designs, an amazing battle system, and an ending that really just makes you smile. We did do the Neutral Route, however. Maybe the Genocide ending isn't so forgiving. I really can't believe I'd ignored it for so long.</p> <p>That said, there was one part I had a problem with. Quite a large problem, in fact. A several hour long problem.</p> <p>It all started on the blue bridge.</p> <p>You see, Berry and I didn't actually start with the idea of doing a Neutral Route. Being the edgy violence oriented weirdos we are, we decided to take on the incredibly grindy and not-worth-it Genocide route. This involved killing literally every single creature in the game. Tactics involved uprooting vegetables and bashing our heads against walls. This actually made the game quite easy as puzzles were pre solved and enemies died faster. It served us well until the fateful blue bridge.</p> <p>We'd been running from this 'Undyne' character along with this weird yellow thing that the game refused to call anything other than 'Monster Kid'. We'd ended up on this blue bridge, where the Kid realized we were indeed, not monsters like him, but - oh no - humans! Devils, demons, terrible creatures! To be exterminated, lest they sink our monster kingdom to ruin! The Kid decided to attempt to fight us. He would've had his ass handed to him if bloody Undyne hadn't come out of nowhere and taken the hit. The next few hours were the most excruciating gaming experience I've ever had.</p> <p>I'm not going to go into it because it was repetitive and annoying. Suffice to say we beat Undyne at quarter past midnight after a ridiculous amount of deaths that probably ended up in the high double-digits. Berry absolutely carried, by the way, being capable of actually memorizing attacks instead of randomly flailing at the controls. She did use me as a meat shield a few times though.</p> <p>When we were done... the texts in that conversation sound like the words of drunks.

Of course it doesn\u2019t . Things change, don\u2019t they? There\u2019s a massive issue with the entire idea behind every single \u2018old Minecraft was better\u2019 video. You can simply choose not to deal with it. Just ignore the newer versions. Sure, everyone else plays on those, but I doubt Sipover has anyone else in their life.</p> <p>And alright, you\u2019re entitled to your opinion. But I think we all know what Sipover was looking for when he wrote this script.</p> <p>But nowadays, I can\u2019t be bothered to start up a new world or even sit through the latest trending YouTube videos.</p> <p>I will admit to also not bothering to make worlds. I always prefer to play on servers, public or with friends. Sometimes I\u2019ll just want to do some mindless PVP to relax. Or to hang with friends, or perhaps making things for \u2018em. That\u2019s only because I personally find nothing fun if I don\u2019t have good people to do it with.</p> <p>Sipover simply doesn\u2019t want to because he\u2019s lazy. You see that in every single video he makes, and his entire outlook on Minecraft as detailed in this one.</p> <p>As for \u2018the latest trending YouTube videos\u2019, that\u2019s completely irrelevant. Mojang might try things to influence their fandom and creators, but that\u2019s ultimately not their purview. Youtube\u2019s gone to shit anyway, with the corporatization of it\u2019s culture. I won\u2019t say Mojang isn\u2019t doing the same thing with their game, but they\u2019re not responsible for what other people do to their game.</p> <p>It could just be that I\u2019d grown up</p> <p>The average age of a Minecraft player is about 24.</p> <p>That scene at 0:39 where all the veterans fade away and Sipover looks around confused</p> <p>Do NOT equate yourself to them. You fuckin\u2019 fraud.</p> <p>Playing classic with a bunch of youtubers</p> <p>You know, I don\u2019t think Minecraft classic had bows.</p> <p>The segment where they play Classic and Sipover preaches about complete creative freedom</p> <p>This is the essence of nostalgia baiting. All those youtubers aren\u2019t happy to see that build because it \u2018captures the essence of Minecraft\u2019 or whatever. No, it\u2019s because it\u2019s an old-ass build that carries cultural significance, which concerns the fandom and not the design of the game itself.</p> <p>And then there\u2019s the bullshit about how Classic promoted complete creative freedom. Complete creative freedom, with a total of about seven colours to work with. Right. And no flying. It\u2019s infinitely easier to make your creations come to life in modern Minecraft, what with creative mode and more block variety and even custom tools like Axiom and Worldedit \u2013 though disregard that last one if you like. Again, that\u2019s got nothing to do with Mojang\u2019s designs.</p> <p>The creative freedom aspect of the game was always there and still is. It never left, it\u2019s just that some people can\u2019t muster up the creative drive or the effort to actually use it.</p> <p>The so-called freedom Sipover references is not what he says it is. It\u2019s not a function of Mojang\u2019s new updates that makes every solution solved and publicisized. It\u2019s time. Unless you somehow kept Minecraft in perfect stasis, of course every problem would eventually be solved. Would you rather they never found their footing in the wider world and stopped giving the game attention until it fell away to obscurity? No fandom to create new things and iterate infinitely? A personal little game, just for you?</p> <p>If beta was the modern version of the game and there was an expansive list of updates that led up to it just like the current situation, Sipover would still be making this video. It\u2019s not about the game, it\u2019s about the people. Was the fandom supposed to keep themselves isolated to preserve the beautiful experience of solving every problem yourself, to never share their creations?</p> <p>Modern Minecraft has an advancements page to follow, certain steps you need to beat the game, millions of tutorials to guide you, and it feels like you never need to use your brain.</p> <p>Sipover, allow me to introduce you to a fundamental part of existence. Using your fucking brain. You may be new to this experience.</p> <p>You do realize you can just, ignore all of that, right? You don\u2019t have to beat the game. You don\u2019t have to listen to advancements. All the aspects that allowed you to play the game how you want are still there \u2013 in fact, I\u2019d say the newer aspects enhance that experience. There\u2019s more options, and no one says you need to take all of them. Weren\u2019t you just saying that players could use their own playstyle?</p> <p>The only reason all of these new features seem like limitations to Sipover is because he is lazy. He doesn\u2019t bother using his brain, and follows the advancements mindlessly because he refuses to even try customizing his experience. It\u2019s sad, it\u2019s pathetic, and now he comes to youtube to drain sympathy from his six year old audience who doesn\u2019t know any better, as well as from any other braindeads like him.</p> <p>One should also take into consideration that beating the game and following tutorials are usually used as crutches to take you into the endgame of Minecraft \u2013 having the resources to do whatever the hell you want. But of course, Sipover is too lazy to even decide what he wants, so he puts those resources nowhere and quits the game instead.</p> <p>For instance, how would you solve this modern day Minecraft problem of being chased by a horde of zombies?</p> <p>This is not a \u2018modern day problem\u2019. This happens in older versions too. Bad phrasing.</p> <p>Ignoring my pedantry, there\u2019s also the fact that you can run from them quite easily in beta as well.</p> <p>Not to mention the obvious elephant in the room: YOU ARE BEING CHASED BY MONSTERS. YOU HAVE NOTHING ON YOU. NO WEAPONS, NOTHING. THERE\u2019S PLENTY OF SPACE TO RUN AWAY ALL AROUND YOU. WHAT ELSE ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO?</p> <p>Modern day Minecraft problem two: you\u2019re running low on items.</p> <p>First off, please stop using those obnoxious sound effects.</p> <p>Secondly, the fact that villager trading exists doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t go out and grind for items in other ways.</p> <p>Third. I have no experience in game design, but Sipover is eschewing a lot of valuable context here. Leveling a toolsmith to the level that they can trade you diamond gear is an arduous process requiring reliable methods to farm emeralds that can take days to set up if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. Hours, even if you do. This isn\u2019t as trivial a thing as he makes it out.</p> <p>Sure, you could argue that once all that\u2019s done it is indeed trivially easy to get gear. That\u2019s just flat out wrong. Villagers sell gear with low level enchantments, and you\u2019ll also need netherite if you want to truly max it out \u2013 and there\u2019s no easy way to get that.</p> <p>If you are satisfied with what villager are selling straight up, I\u2019d still consider it balanced. Because you already put tons of effort in to make it work. It\u2019s the same thing as how we don\u2019t run into the wilderness and build our own manufacturing plants from scratch from the trees. You\u2019ve done all the work already and deserve to reap the results. Why force players to do all the effort over again?</p> <p>Players were required to think creatively to solve these problems, making it a true sandbox</p> <p>Once again, just goddamn ignore the existing solutions. No one is telling you you have to do something. Also, that\u2019s not exactly what I\u2019d consider the largest factor in making a \u2018true sandbox\u2019. There\u2019s tons more to consider. Sorry, I\u2019m being pedantic about sentences again.</p> <p>In my opinion, creating something completely from your own imagination and seeing a vision come to life is much more rewarding and fun.</p> <p>Than what? You can\u2019t just end a sentence on that. There\u2019s nothing else to compare it. But okay, let\u2019s just assume he means the supposed set progression of modern Minecraft. Again: WHAT SET PROGRESSION? The goal of the game is not to beat the dragon. That\u2019s a side mechanic that serves as a gateway to the End and it\u2019s resources, and also a cool trophy for the completionists. Listen to how I phrase it. It\u2019s insignificant. It doesn\u2019t matter. There\u2019s a reason Minecraft\u2019s bosses don\u2019t give you much more than access to just a few features, instead of triggering some grand ending cinematic. Minecraft was never about it\u2019s story. It was about the player\u2019s story. Whatever story they chose to write as they played.</p> <p>And while things like basic redstone and deeper progression were added, the game perfectly held on to that sandbox, open-imagination feel like it did before.</p> <p>Oh yeah, let\u2019s just frame 90% of the features added in the beta era as completely insignificant. Trust me, this Minecraft was way better than modern Minecraft! Don\u2019t mind that all the fundamental mechanics are in both\u2026</p> <p>Notice how all the stuff about the new content is factual, while the latter part is just Sipover\u2019s opinion. And we all know just how valid that is.</p> <p>The temple of Notch is a great reflection of how Beta 1.7.3 Minecraft felt at the time. As soon as you loaded into the map, you were welcomed with a new adventure.</p> <p>But what nature of adventure? Isn\u2019t the Temple of Notch just as rigid and set-progressing as you so proclaimed modern Minecraft is? You spawn in, walk forwards, and stand in a box while Notch does all the action and does something. This is a terrible example of your point.</p> <p>Viewers will notice a slow shift of the theme as we progress through the video from this point on. While Sipover was rebuking the addition of progression to Minecraft, the latter half of the video is just him complaining about all the random extra features Mojang added that have nothing to do with the progression. He even seems to see them as distractions from the progression, the goal \u2013 which is, of course, beating the dragon.</p> <p>That sense of adventure that Beta 1.7.3 has that modern Minecraft just doesn\u2019t</p> <p>Really, Sipover. How much of your arguments just dependent on \u2018just doesn\u2019t\u2019?</p> <p>Now, when I load into a world, I have the next 20 years planned out</p> <p>Once again, that\u2019s only because you choose to follow the normal path. You don\u2019t bother forging your own. And following the normal path is alright, actually. Because that\u2019s all set up. Building the infrastructure upon which you can easier accomplish your actual goals. That\u2019s why so many letsplays start by beating the dragon and setting up a trading hall and then getting to the meat of the letsplay.</p> <p>There\u2019s no villages, no predictable cave generation\u2026</p> <p>Ah yes, because cave generation was always so very predictable. In every version. Always. And if Minecraft had stayed on that version the whole time? Wouldn\u2019t players find solutions to every problem within it too? This \u2018greatness\u2019 you associate with older versions doesn\u2019t come from the inherent design of the game \u2013 it comes from time and the fanbase.</p> <p>In modern Minecraft, I know every threat I could face\u2026</p> <p>That\u2019s called being good at the game, Sipover. You may also be new to this experience.</p> <p>Furthermore, you do realize that updates are usually about adding rather than removing? It\u2019s not like the threats from earlier versions are no longer in modern Minecraft. They\u2019re pretty much all still there. You know how to handle skeletons and zombies, whether they\u2019re in alpha or 1.21. You\u2019re not missing older versions of Minecraft, you\u2019re missing a bygone era. The entirety of the \u2018old Minecraft was better\u2019 argument is built on a subjective foundation of nostalgia.</p> <p>While the game being so carefree and predictable can support other aspects of the game, like building\u2026</p> <p>MY DEAR FRIEND. OTHER ASPECTS, LIKE BUILDING? OTHER????!!!!!!!</p> <p>The entirety of Minecraft is a support system for building. Well, not specifically building, but the act of creation, of using creativity to create. All the other features and processes are used to get items that can then be used in acts of creation, whether building a castle, coding a redstone machine, whatever! You can\u2019t just shove it aside like this. Of course, Sipover wouldn\u2019t notice this. He\u2019s too busy beating the dragon.</p> <p>The Whole Skyblock is great bit</p> <p>Skyblock is not the essence of Minecraft. It is a customized experience of it \u2013 something a player went and developed for themselves and then set out to share. Yeah it\u2019s good, I don\u2019t deny that, but it\u2019s a bad fit for this argument. Everyone knows how to make a cobblestone generator. Everyone knows exactly what to do in Skyblock. So, isn\u2019t it just the same set progression as before?</p> <p>Oh, but what about building your island? Making something of it with the little you have? Problem solving to obtain new resources?</p> <p>The problems are all solved. Skyblock is old, and therefore has tons of people figuring out every single thing in it. Right back to that supposed set progression.</p> <p>Now, building is the aspect that is useful to us here. If we compare skyblock and Minecraft as a whole, we see that skyblock is a microcosm of Minecraft. You set up all the infrastructure \u2013 cobble gen, a tree farm, etc. \u2013 and use them as a crutch to start doing what you actually want. Building your island. Creating new things. Though of course, Sipover probably faked his enthusiasm as he was running out of arguments. The farthest he ever got was the cobble generator.</p> <p>For instance, look at how simple the creative menu is compared to now</p> <p>Are you really telling me that a more organized selection menu is somehow detrimental to finding what you need? The old version didn\u2019t even have a search bar!</p> <p>Choice overload bias</p> <p>That\u2019s not the issue. The issue is you being too lazy to choose.</p> <p>Old minecraft is good for building</p> <p>Are you an AI art supporter, Sipover? Because this is the kind of talk I hear from them. You wish all these newfangled techniques and strategies were never made \u2013 now the bar of entry is too high for your lazy, pampered hands. How does less choice support creative freedom at all? Isn\u2019t freedom supposed to be the ability make your own choices? How is that helped when you have less to choose from?</p> <p>You want everyone to be able to make incredible art with a snap of the finger. You want to diminish respect for people who have actually spent time building up their skills to create masterpieces. They earned those masterpieces with practice, experience, and dedication. You did not earn yours. This thinking is exactly like an AI art supporter\u2019s \u2013 except, instead of raising the unskilled up, you want to pull everybody down, which sounds rather worse. Somehow. It\u2019s a low bar to limbo under, and you still pulled it off.</p> <p>Testing house appearances in modern and old versions</p> <p>First off, subjectivity is a thing. I think they look shitty in both.</p> <p>How good each one looks is indeed because of Minecraft\u2019s changing art style. As I covered the whole democratizing building thing earlier, I won\u2019t repeat myself. With that point covered, the rest of this falls flat as completely unrelated.</p> <p>The modern version looks weird because of its lack of contrast. Cobble just doesn\u2019t work so well when it\u2019s slapped flatly on top of a cube \u2013 older textures made up for this by having a lot more contrast and thus driving more visual interest and depth.</p> <p>\u2018Immersive Simplicity\u2019</p> <p>I\u2019m going to define this term because Sipover neglects to do anything but throw it around like a buzzword.</p> <p>Basically, from what I can tell, immersive simplicity is like a society indoctrinating all its citizens from birth to believe that their lack of options is normal. Immersive.</p> <p>Focused on progressing and being able to survive the night</p> <p>This is like calling the human centipede good for its shameless body horror and lack of depth. I\u2019m stressed trying to survive the night, so I\u2019m immersed. It\u2019s a shock reaction, basically. Also, wasn\u2019t Sipover just earlier calling out the set progression? Why\u2019s he advocating for focusing on a set goal all of a sudden?</p> <p>Meaningless and useless stimulation</p> <p>Y\u2019know, I thought Sipover would love that stuff. After all, isn\u2019t that his entire channel?</p> <p>The entire shtick about Minecraft Youtube</p> <p>Dude. Mojang doesn\u2019t control that.</p> <p>Disregarding that, the change in the nature of Minecraft content is not just because of the newer versions.

I did an experiment where I fired alpha particles into a really thin sheet of gold foil surrounded by a zinc sulfide coated screen. Most of the particles passed through, and some particles even got reflected at large angles, proving that atoms are not just a clump of particles, but is mostly just empty space. The dense nucleus is also why some of the alpha particles got reflected because when the alpha particles collide with the nucleus, the positively charged alpha particles get repelled by the positively charged nucleus reflecting them onto the screen. I conclude that atoms consist of a small but dense nucleus of positive particles containing most of the atom's mass, and negatively charged electrons are scattered around the center of the nucleus, orbiting around it at a distance with lots of empty space in between.

I wanted to share with you, my atomic model! I call it, the planetary model. That smart guy Rutherford thought he did something special by figuring out electrons orbit around the nucleus. But he forgot to include the math that explained WHY they did. Well, I figured that out. You know that new thingy a friend and I developed? A little thing called quantum theory? Well according to that, some physical quantities only take discrete values. If we apply that to the hydrogen atom, then it shows how electrons can only move around the nucleus in prescribed orbits.</p> <p>Random Friend: I\u2019m not sure I understand dude</p> <p>Bohr: Think of it like a set of stairs. You can step onto the step, but you can\u2019t stand in the space between the steps, now can you?</p> <p>Random Friend: Well, actually for a brief moment...</p> <p>For some reason, a strawberry fades in over Bohr\u2019s face.</p> <p>Bohr: That doesn\u2019t fit the narrative. ANYWAY, it also works like that for electrons. They can\u2019t move in the spaces between orbits.  </p> <p>Random Friend: Huh, well that\u2019s pretty interesting. Do you have any more ideas besides atom ladders?</p> <p>Bohr: Oh yes! I made a bunch more theories! So these electrons, as I already told you, are in fixed positions. Because I also theorized that the distance between electrons and the nucleus are based on energy levels. The higher the energy level, the further the electron is from the nucleus. Based on those two facts, then we can assume that the energy level in each orbit is also fixed. This fixed energy level and distance is the TRUE reason why these electrons don\u2019t just spiral out of control and orbit the nucleus like how planets orbit the sun!</p> <p>Random Friend: ...Can you repeat what you just said, but a lot slower?</p> <p>Bohr: NOPE!</p> <p>Random Friend: Okay man, but you said you applied this to the hydrogen atom?</p> <p>Bohr: What about it?</p> <p>Random Friend: Well, don\u2019t you worry that maybe your theory would be too simple for other elements?</p> <p>Bohr: Nonsense, my simple friend, I\u2019m sure that my atomic model would fit well juuuust fine.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/06/10/the-atomic-development-timeline/#interlude_4","title":"Interlude","text":"<p>Cut to a security console as the frame zooms out into one of the console\u2019s screens.
