# Mods

Minecraft mods I made.

## Durtleminer
*Work in Progress*

This is a mod for the Durtle SMP, which contains many features requested by the SMP members.

## Drehmal Regenesis

*Work in Progress*

A Minecraft mod based on the adventure map [Drehmal: Apotheosis](https://drehmal.net).

*After Drehmal collapsed into the Nothing, parts of it containing powerful primal energies resisted decay and wound up in other realms. Now you are burdened with their remnant power. Will you use them wisely, or incur the Mythoclast's intervention again?*

*Work in Progress*

A Minecraft mod aiming to reconstruct all of Diary of an 8-Bit Warrior into Fabric 1.21.
