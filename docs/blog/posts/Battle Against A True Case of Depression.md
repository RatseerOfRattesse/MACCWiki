# Battle Against A True Case of Depression

I hate fish.

Recently, my friend Berry introduced me to a game called Undertale. We grabbed a mod to make it two-player and did a playthrough.

And it was a blast. Beautifully developed story and artwork, with recognizable character designs, an amazing battle system, and an ending that really just makes you smile. We did do the Neutral Route, however. Maybe the Genocide ending isn't so forgiving. I really can't believe I'd ignored it for so long.

That said, there was one part I had a problem with. Quite a large problem, in fact. A several hour long problem.

It all started on the blue bridge.

You see, Berry and I didn't actually start with the idea of doing a Neutral Route. Being the edgy violence oriented weirdos we are, we decided to take on the incredibly grindy and not-worth-it Genocide route. This involved killing literally every single creature in the game. Tactics involved uprooting vegetables and bashing our heads against walls. This actually made the game quite easy as puzzles were pre solved and enemies died faster. It served us well until the fateful blue bridge.

We'd been running from this 'Undyne' character along with this weird yellow thing that the game refused to call anything other than 'Monster Kid'. We'd ended up on this blue bridge, where the Kid realized we were indeed, not monsters like him, but - oh no - humans! Devils, demons, terrible creatures! To be exterminated, lest they sink our monster kingdom to ruin! The Kid decided to attempt to fight us. He would've had his ass handed to him if bloody Undyne hadn't come out of nowhere and taken the hit. The next few hours were the most excruciating gaming experience I've ever had.

I'm not going to go into it because it was repetitive and annoying. Suffice to say we beat Undyne at quarter past midnight after a ridiculous amount of deaths that probably ended up in the high double-digits. Berry absolutely carried, by the way, being capable of actually memorizing attacks instead of randomly flailing at the controls. She did use me as a meat shield a few times though.

When we were done... the texts in that conversation sound like the words of drunks. Probably the closest to being high I've ever gotten.

Here's some messages from that night.
