# Choose to Lose
*A 2D Shooter Game by [idi0cy](https://github.com/idi0cy) and RatseerOfRattesse*

![Game snapshot](../assets/misc/choosetolose1.png)

2D survival-shooter game where you play as a regular civilian who's dreams are being invaded by advertisements. Fight off corpo robots with biblical smiting themed weaponry and select debuffs instead of buffs each round.

???+ tip

    PLEASE download the executable and run that. The web version is SO LAGGY it's practically unplayable. I know you're distrustful of random online games and shit, but FOR YOUR OWN SANITY.
